## Fundamental Analysis Framework

### 1. Business Analysis

- **Business Model**: Understand the company's product/service, target
    market, revenue stream, cost structure, and key
    partnerships/relationships.

- **Industry/Sector/Space**: Identify the industry, understand its
    trends, regulatory environment, market size and growth, and key
    challenges.

- **Competitive Landscape**: Identify direct and indirect competitors,
    understand their strengths and weaknesses, market share, and
    financial performance.

- **Durable Competitive Advantage (DCA)**: Assess factors like brand
    recognition, patents/IP, economies of scale, network effect,
    customer loyalty, and switching costs.

### 2. Growth Drivers

- **Earnings Growth**: Is the company consistently increasing its
    earnings? Look at both the reported earnings and quality of
    earnings.

- **Revenue Growth**: Is the company increasing its top-line revenue?
    Is the revenue growth consistent?

- **Market Expansion**: Is the company expanding into new markets that
    could increase earnings in the future?

- **New Products or Services**: Is the company developing new products
    or services that could contribute to future earnings?

- **Operational Efficiency**: Is the company finding ways to improve
    efficiency, reduce costs, and thereby increase earnings?

- **Strategic Acquisitions**: Has the company made any acquisitions
    that could contribute to earnings growth?

### 3. Risks

- **Industry Risks**: What are the potential risks associated with the
    industry in which the company operates?

- **Competitive Risks**: What are the risks arising from the company's
    competitive landscape?

- **Operational Risks**: What are the risks associated with the
    company's operations, such as supply chain disruptions, labor
    issues, etc.?

- **Regulatory and Legal Risks**: What are the potential regulatory
    and legal challenges the company could face?

- **Financial Risks**: Assess the company's financial health and risks
    such as high debt levels, cash flow issues, etc.

### 4. Financial Analysis

- **Revenue**: This is the top line on the income statement, which
    reflects the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods
    or services. It gives an idea of the size of the company's
    operations.

- **Operating Income**: Also known as operating profit or operating
    earnings, this is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods
    sold, operating expenses, and overhead from revenue. It gives an
    idea of the company's profitability from core operations.

- **Operating Cash Flow**: This is calculated as Operating Income +
    Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures. This measure
    focuses on the cash generated from core operations, providing a
    more direct and less easily manipulated view of cash generation.

- **Operating Cash Flow Margin**: This is calculated as Operating Cash
    Flow / Revenue. It gives an idea of the proportion of revenue that
    is converted into cash flow from operations. A higher ratio
    suggests greater operational efficiency and profitability.

- **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**: Calculate this for both
    revenue and operating cash flow to understand the company's growth
    rate over a specific period. This provides a smoother estimate of
    growth by averaging out yearly fluctuations.

- **Total Growth**: This can be calculated for both revenue and
    operating cash flow over the period of analysis to provide a
    snapshot of the company's overall growth.

This simplified model provides a clear focus on the business's ability
to generate cash from its operations, its profitability, and
growth. Keep in mind, though, that these are not the only measures
that matter, and they should be viewed in the context of other
information about the company and its industry.


### 5. Valuations

- **Earnings**: Gather the company's earnings per share (EPS) from its
    most recent financial statements.

- **Earnings Growth**: Analyze historical earnings data and predict
    how earnings might grow in the future. There are various methods
    to do this, including looking at historical growth rates, industry
    growth rates, or using financial models like Discounted Cash Flow
    (DCF).

- **Multiple**: Decide on a reasonable multiple based on the company's
    expected growth rate. High growth companies typically have higher
    multiples, while lower growth companies have lower multiples. One
    common measure is the PEG ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth), which
    adjusts the P/E ratio for the company's growth rate.

- **Estimated Price**: Multiply the earnings per share by the multiple
    to get the estimated price of the stock.

- **Compare**: Compare this estimated price to the current market
    price of the stock. If your estimated price is higher than the
    current market price, the stock may be undervalued. If your
    estimated price is lower than the market price, the stock may be
    overvalued.

Remember, this is a simplified model.

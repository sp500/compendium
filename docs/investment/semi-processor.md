## Business Model Issues

Qualcomm's 2023Q3 results and Q4 guidance missed analyst expectations,
causing the stock to drop over 8% in pre-market trading. Revenue
declined in both Qualcomm's chipset business (QCT) and licensing
business (QTL) due to slowing smartphone demand and inventory
drawdowns.

- **Structural issues facing Qualcomm**, like loss of modem chip
    business from Apple and Huawei. This could hamper Qualcomm's
    future growth potential.

- **A cyclical company** that will eventually rebound when smartphone
    demand improves, but how long?

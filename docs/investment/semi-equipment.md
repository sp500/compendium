## KLA

### Business

KLA Corporation has a superior business model in the semiconductor
equipment industry for the following reasons:

- Market Leadership in Process Control - KLA dominates the metrology,
  inspection, and process control segment for semiconductors with over
  55% market share. This gives it a commanding position in an
  essential niche.

- Sticky Customer Relationships - Once KLA tools are installed at fabs
  for process control, customers are unlikely to replace them as
  processes are optimized around KLA's instrumentation. This leads to
  recurring revenue.

- High Barriers to Entry - The technical expertise and IP required to
  develop advanced process control systems makes it difficult for new
  entrants to displace KLA.

- Unique Offerings - KLA is the only equipment company focused on
  metrology, inspection, and control. Peers mainly provide
  semiconductor processing/manufacturing tools.

- Insulated from Cyclicality - Demand for yield improvement is
  constant, insulating KLA from the boom/bust cycles of chip
  manufacturing investments.

- Financial Strength - KLA has industry-leading profit margins, cash
  reserves, and cash flow. This provides stability and allows
  continued R&D investment.

- Exposure to Cutting Edge Nodes - Even during downturns, R&D for
  leading-edge nodes continues where KLA's tools are critical for
  yield ramping.

In summary, KLA's specialization in process control, market dominance,
customer stickiness, financials, and demand stability make its
business model stand out as superior and resilient versus peers
exposed to semiconductor manufacturing cycles. This explains Wall
Street's bullishness.

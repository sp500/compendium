## KLA

### Business

KLA Corporation has a superior business model in the semiconductor
equipment industry for the following reasons:

- Market Leadership in Process Control - KLA dominates the metrology,
  inspection, and process control segment for semiconductors with over
  55% market share. This gives it a commanding position in an
  essential niche.

- Sticky Customer Relationships - Once KLA tools are installed at fabs
  for process control, customers are unlikely to replace them as
  processes are optimized around KLA's instrumentation. This leads to
  recurring revenue.

- High Barriers to Entry - The technical expertise and IP required to
  develop advanced process control systems makes it difficult for new
  entrants to displace KLA.

- Unique Offerings - KLA is the only equipment company focused on
  metrology, inspection, and control. Peers mainly provide
  semiconductor processing/manufacturing tools.

- Insulated from Cyclicality - Demand for yield improvement is
  constant, insulating KLA from the boom/bust cycles of chip
  manufacturing investments.

- Financial Strength - KLA has industry-leading profit margins, cash
  reserves, and cash flow. This provides stability and allows
  continued R&D investment.

- Exposure to Cutting Edge Nodes - Even during downturns, R&D for
  leading-edge nodes continues where KLA's tools are critical for
  yield ramping.

In summary, KLA's specialization in process control, market dominance,
customer stickiness, financials, and demand stability make its
business model stand out as superior and resilient versus peers
exposed to semiconductor manufacturing cycles. This explains Wall
Street's bullishness.

### Growth

??? Info "2022Q4"
    So in summary, KLA showed strong double-digit percentage revenue
    and earnings growth over Q4 2022. Significantly exceeding
    analyst estimates.

    Revenue growth:
    - Q4 revenue was $2.36 billion, up 32% year-over-year from $1.79 billion in Q4 2021

    Earnings growth:
    - Q4 GAAP diluted EPS was $4.99, up 37% from $3.64 in Q4 2021
    - Q4 Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, up 39% from $3.88 in Q4 2021

    Some additional details on revenue:

    - Semiconductor Process Control revenue was $1.88 billion, up 38%
      year-over-year

    - Specialty Semiconductor Process revenue was $283 million, up 12%

    - PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $197 million,
      up 22%

## QCOM

### Business Model Issues

Qualcomm's 2023Q3 results and Q4 guidance missed analyst expectations,
causing the stock to drop over 8% in pre-market trading. Revenue
declined in both Qualcomm's chipset business (QCT) and licensing
business (QTL) due to slowing smartphone demand and inventory
drawdowns.

| Business Segment | | Q3 2023 Revenue (millions) | % of Total Q3 2023 Revenue | Q3 2022 Revenue (millions) | % of Total Q3 2022 Revenue | Growth Rate |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| QCT | | $7,174 | 85% | $9,378 | 86% | -23% |
| | Smartphone | $5,255 | 62% | $7,047 | 64% | -25% |   
| | IoT | $1,485 | 18% | $1,946 | 18% | -24% |
| | Automotive | $434 | 5% | $385 | 4% | 13% |
| QTL | |$1,230 | 15% | $1,519 | 14% | -19% |
| QSI | |$9 | 0% | $8 | 0% | 13% |  
| Total | | $8,451 | 100% | $10,936 | 100% | -23% |



- **Structural issues facing Qualcomm**, like loss of modem chip
    business from Apple and Huawei. This could hamper Qualcomm's
    future growth potential.

- **A cyclical company** that will eventually rebound when smartphone
    demand improves, but how long?

## Analyzing Multiple Time Frames

**HTF**

- trend
- key supply and demand levels

**LTF**

- liquidity
- FVG

Look for alignment and confluence between structures


## Market Structure

**Candlestick-based trends**

- Uptrend: Series of bullish candles with higher highs and equal/higher lows
- Downtrend: Series of bearish candles with lower lows and equal/lower highs

**Valid pullbacks**

- Bullish: Breaks below previous candle low and sweeps liquidity
- Bearish: Breaks above previous candle high and sweeps liquidity

**Impulse** Strong trending move in direction of overall trend

**Correction** Retracement against trend that sweeps liquidity

**Change of character**

- Break and close below corrective swing low (uptrend)
- Break and close above corrective swing high (downtrend)


## Support and Resistance

Key levels of support and resistance are identified as significant
points for potential trade opportunities.

We call an area where the price reverses resistance, indicating
selling pressure and buyers closing longs

We call an area where the price reverses support, indicating buying
pressure and sellers closing shorts

Key reasons to mark these zones:
- Price may react to them again
- Identify market direction from breaks
- Identify liquidity areas

## Supply and Demand Zones

Supply and demand areas form when smart money enters, causing significant price movements
Valid demand forms with aggressive buying and momentum candles
Valid supply forms with aggressive selling and momentum candles
Fair value gaps indicate imbalance between buyers and sellers
Price revisits these areas to fill orders and restore balance
Breaking structure levels also confirms momentum
Marking Supply and Demand Zones
Identify fair value gaps and structure breaks first
Mark demand from high to low of last candle in sequence
Mark supply from low to high of last candle in sequence
Stop loss should be in a safe place in case of fluctuations
Types of Supply and Demand Zones
Order blocks - Optimized S/D zones after momentum moves
Order flow - Where buying/selling pressure was building before move
Consolidation areas - Where buyers and sellers are in equilibrium before breakout

## Key Factors Driving Market Movements


## Liquidity Zones

Liquidity simply means large orders or money that must be fulfilled by
the market. It serves as the lifeblood of the market, playing a vital
role in the overall dynamics and functioning.

Liquidity zones are areas on a price chart with significant volumes of
orders, such as stop losses and buy/sell orders.

**Equal highs/lows and swing highs/lows** Liquidity accumulates below
  equal lows or swing lows as buying interest may accumulate
  there. Similarly, liquidity can be found above equal highs or swing
  highs where selling pressure may accumulate.

**Dynamic trend lines and channels** Liquidity zones form above or
  below dynamic trend line and channel boundaries because traders may
  place pending orders there.

**Order blocks and order flows** Areas where significant buy or sell
  orders have been executed or are clustered can act as liquidity
  zones.


**Support and resistance levels** Price levels that have previously
acted as support or resistance attract market participants, making
them potential liquidity areas.

**Daily candle bodies and shadows** Liquidity can be present near the
bodies or shadows of daily candles, reflecting price rejections and
trading activity.  Session highs/lows

**High and low points of trading sessions** represent liquidity zones
due to increased participant activity.

**Fibonacci levels** Traders monitor key Fibonacci retracement or
extension levels, making them liquidity areas.


Liquidity sweeps involve the market sweeping orders at specific zones,
often before reversals or significant price movements.


Using Liquidity in Trading Strategies

When using liquidity in trading strategies, first identify the underlying trend and a valid break of structure. Anticipate a price pullback towards a point of interest to fill the inefficiency left behind. Before entering, look for a liquidity sweep pattern to confirm demand strength in your area of interest. Use liquidity sweeps as a confluence factor. The goal is for price to sweep liquidity to sustain its movement. If price fails to sweep liquidity before your entry, it may use that area as fuel instead and it's unsafe to trade.

In an example consolidation, wait for a sweep of internal liquidity below equal lows. Then monitor for price to enter a higher timeframe demand zone. On the lower timeframe, look for a change of character and new point of interest to go long, targeting external liquidity like a swing high.

Avoiding Inducement Zones

Institutions create inducement zones to deceive retail traders into providing liquidity. Be aware of fake demand zones as potential traps. In an example, a false demand zone induces longs above it before sweeping liquidity below and moving up strongly. Avoid these zones and focus on trading with confirmed liquidity sweeps instead.

Real Chart Trad

### Identifying Fair Value Gaps

- Fair value gaps
    - Market tends to fill gaps and rebalance
    - Price moves to fill gaps and clear liquidity

- Formed in 3 candle sequence, large candle body
- Space between wicks is the fair value gap zone
- Absence of buying/selling pressure creates gap
- Potent entry points as market attracted to liquidity  

## Internal vs External Liquidity 

- External liquidity - Highs and lows of rally waves
- Internal liquidity - Fair value gaps within range
- Price moves between internal and external liquidity

### Price Movement Pattern

- Goes from high/low point to fair value gap 
- Goes from fair value gap to high/low point
- Example rally wave:
    1. Sweeps external liquidity above previous high
    2. Shifts to internal liquidity/fair value gap
    3. Transitions back to external liquidity above high
    4. Drops to fill recent fair value gap
    
- Consider order flow to anticipate direction
- Price action at fair value gap indicates direction

## Real Chart Examples 

- Bullish rally wave sweeps external liquidity below low
- Retraces to fill fair value gap (internal liquidity)
- Reverses down to sweep external liquidity
- Examples showing price oscillating between internal and external liquidity
- Pending video on trading strategy for this concept

## Candle Patterns

**Candle Color Change** show momentum loss or a reversal signal

**Decreasing candle size** near key levels show momentum loss.

**Long Wick Candles** failed at key levels show a reversal signal.

**Multiple Rejections** of several candles rejecting at a key level
  show a reversal signal

**Dojis** show indecisions by buyers and sellers.

**Inside Bars** high/low within previous candle's range show a reversal signal

**Big candles** show momentum gain. When big candles approaching
levels indicates a higher chance of breaking through the key levels.

**Bullish Engulfing**

- Bigger green candle engulfs entire red candle
- Bigger green candle opens at red candle close 

**Bullish Engulfing Momentum**: Much bigger green candle than previous
  green or red candles

**Bearish Engulfing**- Bigger red candle engulfs entire green candle
- Bigger red candle opens at green candle close

**Bullish Engulfing Momentum**: Much bigger red candle than previous
  green or red candles

## Trading Strategies

### Engulfing Confirmation

1. Identify key level or wide zone around unclear levels
2. Wait for engulfing candle as confirmation
3. Draw an **immediate** or **long-term** trendline
4. Check for real or fake breakout, or
5  Use lower time frame to check
6. Look for entries, or continuous entries

A breakout could be a false one which traps traders and causes more
momentum.

## Bollinger Band

### Overview


Bollinger Bands are a set of lines plotted around a moving average of
a stock's price. Developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s, these bands
are designed to adapt to price volatility in a stock (or other
financial instrument). Bollinger Bands consist of three lines:

**Middle Band**: This is typically a 20-day simple moving average
(SMA) of closing prices, although the time period can be adjusted.

**Upper Band**: This is calculated by adding a chosen number of
standard deviations (usually two) to the middle band.

**Lower Band**: This is calculated by subtracting a chosen number
of standard deviations (usually two) from the middle band.

---

### Volatility Measurement

**The width of the bands** can serve as an indicator of market
volatility. A widening gap between the bands indicates increasing
volatility, while a narrowing gap suggests decreasing volatility.

**Bollinger Bandwidth** is a measure of the width of the Bollinger
Bands and is calculated as the difference between the upper band and
the lower band divided by the middle band. Decreasing bandwidth
indicates decreased volatility, while increasing bandwidth indicates
increased volatility.

----

### Strong Trends

**The Width of the Bands** often increases in a strongly trending
market as the volatility (standard deviation) is greater. This is due
to the fact that price movements are more extreme during a strong
trend.

**Riding the Bands** prices usually hover between the middle and one
of the outer bands during a strong trend. When prices are consistently
near the upper Bollinger Band, the market is considered to be in a
strong upward trend. Conversely, when prices hover near the lower
Bollinger Band, a strong downward trend is implied.

**Band Squeeze** where the upper and lower bands come close together,
often precedes a breakout into a new trend. When a strong trend
follows a squeeze, it can signal that the trend is likely to continue
for some time.

**Volumn** can provide additional context to the band movements. For
example, a price touch of the upper band accompanied by strong volume
may reinforce a bullish outlook, while the same touch with weak volume
may be less convincing.

----

### Trend Reversal

**Failed Band Breakout** in Bollinger Bands occur when the price of an
  asset breaches one of the outer bands (either upper or lower) but
  reverses direction instead of sustaining the initial trend,
  effectively returning within the band's range. This phenomenon
  contradicts the traditional expectation that a breakout would lead
  to a continuation of the trend in the same direction, thereby
  serving as a potential contrarian indicator. 

**W-bottoms and M-tops** patterns occur when the price forms W-shaped
  bottoms or M-shaped tops. A W-bottom is considered a bullish
  reversal pattern that generally forms at the end of a
  downtrend. Conversely, an M-top is a bearish reversal pattern that
  typically forms at the end of an uptrend.

**Band Squeeze** or sharp changes in the width of the bands can often
signal an impending price reversal.

**Confluence with Support/Resistance** Bands sometimes align with
  support and resistance levels, amplifying the significance of a
  bounce or break.

**Countertrend Reversals** After a significant period of trending,
  prices touching the opposite band are sometimes viewed as potential
  reversal signals for short-term countertrend plays.

**Relative Length of Wick** When using candlestick charts, the
  relative length of the wick that stretches out of the band can also
  be an indicator. A longer wick that stretches out but fails to
  sustain above/below the band can sometimes signify overextension and
  potential reversal.

### Candlestick Patterns
Candlestick patterns like doji, hammer, or engulfing patterns can be used in conjunction with Bollinger Bands.

### Tagging vs. Penetrating Bands
Understand the difference between a "tag" and a penetration of the band.

### Gaps and Bollinger Bands
Price gaps that lead to band breakouts can signify stronger trends or reversals.

### Price and Band Crossover
Crossover of the price and the middle band can signify trend confirmation.

### Harmonics and Chart Patterns
Bollinger Bands can be combined with harmonic patterns for more refined entry and exit points.

### Bollinger Bounce and Squeeze Confirmation
Look for a confirming signal after a Bollinger Band squeeze or bounce.

### Cumulative Indicators
Adding cumulative indicators like On Balance Volume (OBV) can provide additional context.

### Correlation with Other Assets
Price action of related assets can be used in conjunction with Bollinger Bands.

### Adaptive Bollinger Bands
Adjust the settings of the bands based on market conditions for a more responsive analysis.

### Beta Adjustment
Adjust Bollinger Bands based on the stock's beta to interpret it in the context of market behavior.

### Time-Series Forecasting
Use Bollinger Bands in conjunction with time-series forecasting methods like ARIMA.

### Higher Highs and Lower Lows
Watch for higher highs or lower lows in the bands to confirm trends.

### Rate of Change
The rate of change of the band width can indicate volatility acceleration or deceleration.

### How It Is Calculated

Here's how each band is calculated:

$\mathbf{\text{Middle Band}} = \frac{\text{Sum(Close Price)}}{N}$

$\mathbf{\text{Upper Band}} = \text{Middle Band} + (k \times \text{Standard Deviation})$

$\mathbf{\text{Lower Band}} = \text{Middle Band} - (k \times \text{Standard Deviation})$

Where:

- \(N\) is the number of periods (usually days).
- \(k\) is the chosen number of standard deviations (usually 2).
- \( \text{Standard Deviation} \) is calculated based on the \(N\) periods of closing prices.

---

### Concept Behind the Math

The mathematical concept behind Bollinger Bands centers around
statistical variations, encapsulated by the standard deviation
which provides an indication of volatility.

**Middle Band (SMA)**: This serves as the baseline around which the
bands are drawn and represents a rolling average of prices, smoothing
out fluctuations.
   
**Standard Deviation**: This statistic captures the volatility of
the stock price. Higher standard deviation means higher volatility,
and lower standard deviation means lower volatility.

**Upper and Lower Bands**: Adding or subtracting standard
deviations from the SMA helps to encapsulate the stock's
volatility. When prices are stable, the bands will narrow. During
times of high volatility, the bands will widen.

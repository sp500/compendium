# Ownership

??? Info "Quote"

    ```
    When a team takes ownership of its problems, the problem gets
    solved. It is true on the battlefield, it is true in business, and
    it is true in life.

    Responsibility equals accountability equals ownership. And a sense
    of ownership is the most powerful weapon a team or organization can
    have.

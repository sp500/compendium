# Github Adoption

This site provides basic guidelines for Fieldpiece and its vendors to
develop products on Github.

## Business Needs <a id="needs"></a>

- A platform for multiple teams to implement a large scale project
- A version control system to track deliverables
- A project manage system to prioritize tasks and improve visibility and accountability
- A communication platform to identify purpose and define right problems
- A information space for production packages and tech support

## Contributing

During guideline development, ideas and suggestions from all project
participants and developers of all organizations will be valued. The
initial release will be a part of development SOP (Standard of
Operation). Full compliance follows below steps and timelines:

1. Non-compliance instances and reasons will be identified.
2. Clarifications or trainings will be provided.
3. Non-compliance account will be on-hold to resolve issues.

Each step takes max 7 days.

## Adaption

Ongoing improvements will be tracked in new releases through
discussions, feature requests, or bug reports.

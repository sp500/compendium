### Summary

The video discusses the book "有錢人想的和你不一樣" (translated as
"Rich People Think Differently") by Harvey Eker, which explores the
differences in mindset between wealthy individuals and those who
struggle financially. It emphasizes the importance of adopting a
wealthy mindset to achieve financial success.

Facts

💰 Wealthy individuals understand the importance of hard work and
dedicate themselves to creating wealth, while poor people often only
"wish" to become rich without taking real action.

💡 There are three levels of desire for money: "I want to be rich"
(mere wishful thinking), "I choose to be rich" (making a decision),
and "I am committed to being rich" (dedicating oneself fully).

🤝 Being committed to wealth means being willing to make sacrifices,
such as working long hours, giving up leisure time, and putting
maximum effort into one's endeavors.

📚 The book emphasizes the idea that changing visible outcomes in life
requires changing the invisible mindset behind them.

🌳 Similar to a tree bearing fruit, wealth is the result of strong
roots (mindset) and nourishment (actions) that happen beneath the
surface.
